# Fantasy-F1-League

<div style="text-align: justify">

Data processing code for the official Formula 1 fantasy league. Please note, if you are here because you think I have cracked the web scraping issue with the official fantasy league website, I am sorry to disappoint, but I haven't. What this repository contains is the data processing for calculating statistics, predicting trends, plotting league graphs, etc. I set up this repository as a league owner to show off the league statistics to my friends and competitors, and because I just really enjoy coding. Please feel free to use the code as described by the license.

Note that this code contains a vitrual environment. Names of managers/competitors have been censored for privacy.

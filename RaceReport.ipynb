    "In case you've been living under a rock for the last few months, here's a brief summary of some of the major events that have happened since we saw Max doing donuts in Abu Dhabi. Lewis Hamilton signed a multi-year deal with Ferrari, breaking his contract with Mercedes a year early, and joining the Scuderia in 2025 and beyond. The Brit will replace Carlos Sainz, who is yet to sign a replacement contract. Alfa Romeo left the sport and the Sauber team re-branded as Stake F1 Kick Sauber, though this name is not the official name as Stake is banned in a lot of countries, including Switzerland where the Sauber brand is based. The team launched their bright green machine and immediately realised that they may have to rename themselves Kick Sauber. Guenther Steiner, the legend of Driver To Survive, was let go by Haas F1 with immediate effect. There was little explanation for the departure of the iconic team principle, from the American outfit, but it seems like a knee-jerk reaction from a team struggling to stay afloat in an expensive business. Alpine launched a disastrous car with very little in the way of paint, with their team losing some key members from the team in the last few weeks. The French outfit are looking to be the worst on the grid in testing and it can only get better from here. Though, after the sacking of their team principle last year, the Enstone team have had nothing but issues. Then there's the Christian Horner investigation. I am not going to comment much on this because it has been dropped by parent company Red Bull GmbH after an independent investigation. Rumours are circling and I'm sure, if there is any truth behind them, it will all come out in the wash.\n",

    "\n",
    "It may have been 3 months, an entire off-season of development, rumours about Mercedes and mcLaren during testing, and a complete re-design of the most dominant car in F1 history, but it's business as usual at the front for the reigning world champion. After reporting some handling issues and gearbox issues in free practice, Max went on to secure a comfortable pole position on Friday evening in Bahrain. The Dutchman was a good 3 tenths of a second ahead of nearest competitor Charles Leclerc, who recently signed a multi-year extension at the Italian team. It was significantly closer going down the field, with George Russell showing some good pace in third, Sainz in fourth, Perez in fifth, and the hero of 2023 Fernando Alonso in sixth place. If this is indicative of the season ahead, we are in for a close competition behind Max.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some standout performances include Nico Hulkenberg, who after new team principle Komatsu said \"we are the slowest car\", popped his newly designed Haas into Q3 1 second behind 7 time champion Lewis Hamilton. Teammate Kevin Magnussen also managed to scrape a Q2 appearance, making it a strong opening gambit from Haas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things are not well at the French team of Alpine it seems. With senior members resigning, their owner brandishing wild claims in the media, a list of A-listers sent in last season to provide investment, a paint-less car, and weak testing performance, neither Alpine was able to make it off the back row of the grid. There are some serious reliability concerns down at Alpine too, with the team worried if they will survive the hotter Grand Prix of the year. There's much work to be done and everyone is being very positive on social media, but if last year taught us anything, it's that Gasly and Ocon are not team players with each other.\n",

    "### Race Report\n",
    "\n",
    "As races go, that was definitely one of them. It wasn't exactly what we have come to expect from Formula 1 in the not-too-distant past, but it is certainly what we have come to expect from Max Verstappen in the last year or so. The Dutchman romped home to a 22-second victory over teammate Sergio Perez. There was never really a moment of doubt for Max, despite Sky Sports claiming Leclerc nearly collided with him into turn 1. It was a strong performance from Perez though, who was able to cleverly preserve his tyres and pick his battles in a rare turn of form from the Mexican driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite a third and fourth place, things are clearly not ok at Ferrari. Carlos Sainz is clearly out to prove a point this year, and honestly I don't blame him at all. The Spanish star was the only non-Red Bull driver to win a Grand Prix in 2023, and was dropped at the first opportunity in favour of Hamilton, who let's not forget hasn't won a race since Saudi Arabia 2021. Frustrated behind his teammate, who seemed to be suffering with brakes, Sainz took the opportunity to pass into turn 1 and he never looked back. Pulling back a gap to Perez, but sadly to no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems to be fairly close between the McLarens, Mercedes, and (in the right conditions) the Astons. George, Norris, Lewis, and Oscar were all fairly close throughout the race, with Fernando seemingly running his own race not too far behind. These three teams are going to make or break the fight for second in the championship this year if they can close that gap to Ferrari later in the year. It is certainly going to be close.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not something that I have spoken about yet, but the newly branded RB team, or Visa CashApp Racing Bulls, or whatever name they're going by, is becoming quite the hotbed for that second Red Bull seat. It's been no secret in the past that Red Bull typically promote from their junior team. It's also no secret that Yuki Tsunoda is tipped to replace Sergio Perez, that was until Ricciardo arrived back on the scene. McLaren's last race winner is keen to make a return to the top team before his time is up, and Yuki knows it. After the race, and after that team swap call, Yuki dive bombed Danny into the hairpin and came up alongside to show the team how upset he was with the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things look to be ok at Alpine with the team gaining two places for each driver, however if you actually look at why they gained positions, it's not good news. Hulkenberg, Bottas, and Stroll collided into turn 1, and Sargeant's shiny new dash caused brake bias chaos into turn 4, thus promoting the two French drivers. Despite Hulk's crash, the Alpines had no answer for the Haas pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is, however, the first time in F1 history that all cars have finished the opening race. A nice way to start the first season where all drivers have progressed from the previous season. A race of firsts in the history of our sport.\n",

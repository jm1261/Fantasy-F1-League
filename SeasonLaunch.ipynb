    "# 2024 Season Launch\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome managers old and new to the brand new season of our little F1 Fantasy League, which this year is sticking with the name Rawe Ceek. If you're unfamiliar with that name, let me direct you to the Rawe Ceek meme and give you time to go and Google why that's funny. It's a tired joke now but that makes it perfect for a Fantasy League name. Hopefully you are all geared up and ready for the longest season we've ever had, and despite the few drop outs we've had this year, we have a very busy league again. I believe we have 60 teams this year, which is a slight step down from the previous, but the pot is bigger than ever!\n",
    "\n",
    "Without getting ahead of myself here, let me run through some of the finer details of the league that have been lost in the noise recently. All of the points scoring and team management is done using the [F1 Fantasy App/Site](https://fantasy.formula1.com/en/). The points, penalty, transfer, and perk systems are all explained on that website in the Rules section. I do not have any influence on how this is done, so don't blame me when/if things go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I do do (compose yourself) is keep track of everyone's statistics, transfers, team lineups, points, values, etc. I also provide weekly race reports, gossip, tasty liveries, and much more to try and engage with some like-minded people about a sport I have followed and loved for nearly 3 decades. If you're here, that means you either feel the same, want to win some money, or you like bating Hamilton fans as much as the next person. Either way, it's all good with me as long as we respect each other enough to know when the joke stops. Deal?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Team Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "As many of you now know, you get up to 3 teams with each registered email, and they can all be entered ino the league using the code C6YB4IHI405. Though chances are you're reading this after the league has begun so you already know all of this. Teams are recorded and locked in at the start of qualifying 1, so any changes made to your team after this are not counted for the current race weekend, unless you use the final fix perk (see game rules for more). This means that you need to decide on any substitutions or alterations prior to qualifying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Team names can be chosen by the user, though F1 does have some rules about what you can choose to call your teams, and they shouldn't be directly targeted at each other. Let's just be nice about it eh? There's no rule I have about targeting names towards members of the actual F1 community, so go for it if you want. All I ask is that you keep your team names constant for the duration of the league, as going back through and changing anything for my own code, is a bit of a pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a small sub-section of our league that compete for a \"Golf Score\". The aim here is to achieve the lowest score possible without taking penalties, i.e., without artificially creating negative scores. Anyone is welcome to compete in this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prizes\n",
    "\n",
    "There is absolutely no need to commit to the prize fund, it is entirely optional. Every year, I run a series of challenges that managers can attempt to achieve with their teams and are rewarded with financial gain from the community pot. 100% of the collected money is paid out, this is a non-profit system. Entry is Â£5 per email account, and should be paid prior to the start of the first qualifying session. This is an attempt to stop people holding off on paying in to the pot before they know they've got a good/bad team. It's all about fairness. The prizes typically stay constant from year to year, though there are some that change depending on the calendar. Below are the prizes available for this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### League\n",
